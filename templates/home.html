        <h3><u>Context:</u></h3>
        <p>
          I have lived in Los Angeles my entire life particularly in the areas deemed the most dangerous. Entertainments in movies and shows such as 'Boyz N The Hood', 'South Central', and most recently 'Snowfall' have show cased the entire world what life was like in South Central Los Angeles, my hometown. Despite the worst periods such as in the 80s/90s, crime has substantially fallen compared to those periods, however, various areas in Los Angeles are still ridden with crime. After reading several articles about crime in other cities and I was surprised that Los Angeles was not even in the top 10 most dangerous cities in America from a 2023, <a href="https://www.southwestjournal.com/most-dangerous-cities-in-the-us-2023-a-comprehensive-analysis/" target="_blank"> news article</a>. Where St. Louis, Missouri rank the most dangerous city in America and Detroit, Michigan taking the number two spot. As a resident of Los Angeles I get to see a first hand view of the crime in the city and some notable observations I saw was an increase in crime around 2016 the same time Trump got into office and a resurgence of crime after the pandemic. As a data analyst, I wanted to investigate the crime data particularly in my city and see if any noticeable trends occured. I wrote down some key questions I wanted to answer. <br> <br>
          <h3><u>Questions to Answer</u></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>What was the overall crime trend in Los Angeles over the last couple years?</li>
            <li>What areas in Los Angeles are considered the most dangerous?</li>
            <li>What crime types were the most prevalent in the last couple of years?</li>
            <li>How does crime compared quarterly throughout the year?</li>
          </ol>
          <h3><u>Hypothesis</u></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Crime was cooling up to 2016, where it ticked back up and crime increased again around 2020.</li>
            <li>Downtown Los Angeles is one of the worst areas.</li>
            <li>I suppose theft and assualt being some of the top crimes committed.</li>
            <li>Usually around summer time, crime gets worst compare to in the winter.</li>
          </ol>        
          <h3><u>Data Set Information:</u></h3>
          I gathered the data from the LA City Website, which came in two big excel files where one contained <a href="https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z" target="_blank">Los Angeles crime data from 2010 to 2019</a>, and had a total of 2,135,664 observations. The second excel file contained <a href="https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8" target="_blank">crime data from 2020 to the most recent date July, 2023</a> and came with 757,141 observation points. 
          <h3><u>Tools Used for Analysis</u></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Planet Scale - Cloud Database (AWS Storage)</li>
            <li>MySQL (Data cleaning)</li>
            <li>Python (For Visualizations)</li>

        <h3 align="center">Data Analysis</h3>
        The first challenge that I faced in this project was the large amount of data which became an issue when storing the data. Also immediately my Power BI Service came with limitations about the amount of data it can handle for my dashboard creation, luckily it felt short just under 1 GB which was the maximum. Some of the data preparation performed was cleaning the data by fixing the date column which came as a string, renamed some of the columns, and dropped some of the useless attributes for my analysis. Then I combined the two tables with a union statement and formulated my own table to gain the entire picture which nearly totaled 3 million rows. I connect the database onto python using SQLAlchemy and continued my visualizations process with various libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Some of the key metrics I wanted to focus on was crime count and average ages for the victims. I also wanted to take advantege of the Longitude and Latitude coordinates of the crimes committed for my reporting tool.

        From the chart above, we can see that crime started to increase after a steady decline around 2014 and reaching a top point around 2015. My hypothesis about crime after the pandemic was correct where we saw a huge increase and recieved a crime count of over 200,000 in just 2022. Note: The count involves all types of crimes committed with some being more severe than others. Also observe the sharp decline in 2023, that's because the crime count for this year is still being counted while we are barely make it half way through the year.

        </p>
        The crime count between the years 2018 and 2022, we can see crime decrease 17% in 2 years and then it rose 22% after the pandemic. Next we see which area of Los Angeles are the most dangerous.

        The police divisions are divided into areas in L.A. which are named on the y-axis and we can see during the time period 2010-2023, 77th Street division has been one of the most dangerous areas. It is specifically located in South LA and I'm actually quite familiar with this division. Now comparing only the last 3 years, we can see that the most dangerous area in Los Angeles was the central area which composes of districts such as Downtown, Hollywood, Wilshire, and Korea Town. Personally, I have seen through out the years those specific areas become hot spot for a lot of thefts. Also recall during the pandemic, a lot of protest and uproar happening in Downtown.

        </p>
        Now comparing quarterly crime throughout the year you can slightly see bit more crime occuring during Q2 & Q3 of the year but honestly, the difference is hardly noticeable. Therefore, you can argue that the quarters of the year do not make a difference in crime which came as a shock to me since I hypothesized that around Summer time it would be more crime inducing. My assumptions was that since more people are outside and the heat would be significant triggers. Next we check some of the most prevalent crime types.  
        <P align="center">

        The most committed crimes in 2010-2023 were battery-simple assault, vehicle stolen, burglary from vehicle, and burglary in general. Los Angeles is notorious for burglary, always try to avoid wearing flashing items and I often tell people to always be aware of your surroundings. Now, the top 5 crime types between 2018 - 2023, were similar but with slightly different reordering. 
        <h3 align="center">Victim Analysis</h3>
        Here I wanted to look at the crime count on the victims by sex. Most of the crimes were against males, however, the difference compared to female victims was not huge with a 11% difference. 
        <p align="center">
          <img src="..\static\Images\victim_gender.png" title="Total Crime by Year" height="300" width="400">

        <P align="center">
          <img src="..\static\Images\victim_ethnicity.png" title="Total Crime by Year" height="350" width="540">
          <img src="..\static\Images\Descent.png" title="Total Crime by Year" height="400" width="300">
        </P>
        Most of the victims age on average regardless of ethnicity seemed to be over 30 years old. This was quite interesting to me, why is there a lot of crime being commited on people over 30? Now check out my dashboard creation that displays crime on a map and a play button for a timeline.
